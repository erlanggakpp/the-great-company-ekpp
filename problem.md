**The Great Company** needs you to create a payment app that enables customer to pay public services and bills.

Your task, is to create a REST API service that has several bussiness requirements
- get a list of services/bills by category of **utility (electricity, water bills), internet, bank credit cards (manual) and post paid phone services**
- receives user input of service/bill to be paid
- the amount of transaction is determined by the service/bill chosen. Some might able to be manually inputted, some needs to be inquiried first to get the amount of transaction
- do the actual transaction
- generate the receipt of transaction into PDF

#### Rules
- Design the REST API using any framework and any language you feel comfortable
- Use any database you feel comfortable
- Design the database for the requirements
- Create a repository to host all the source code
- Design pattern applications are a big plus
- A frontend user interface is a plus
- Deployed REST API is a plus


#### Result
- A repo link (preferably Github)
- A postman collection (Swagger is also okay)
